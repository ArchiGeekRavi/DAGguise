=    * 1 Activities that build leadership skills among members=

I wrote an intro for this section because, besides for it being the only section without one, leadership building is an important part of a club's survival, regardless if no one specifically mentioned it. A club must actively train leaders if it wants to be able to effectively operate past a few years.

I added a paragraph to this section because there was no examples of ways to become or improve ones leadership skills, and why these types of activities are important.

I added an example from the Scottish County Dance Club because I thought it was a great way to show how a leader should be chosen, in a natural way. Rebecca slowly gained respect from the members and they grew to listen and trust what she said, the changes she made in any routines etc.

=    * 2 Challenges of Leadership/Communication=
I added to this part of the page as I thought it would outline the positive of the rest of the page's content if the problems of being in a leadership role of an AS club were presented. 
==          o 2.1 Ways to communicate effectively==
I did an intro for this section because I thought it would be a more effective way to start of the section. Also I just felt like it needed an extra something to get the reader interested and ready for the section.
