== What is the background to this research?==

Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a degenerative neurological condition that affects a persons ability to control their movement through a decline in dopamine availability.<ref name="Vic">Parkinson's Disease - Conditions and Treatments. (2016). Better Health. https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/parkinsons-disease</ref> PD is not known to be fatal nor contagious, however it is still quite prevalent with over 70,000 Australians living with the disease.<ref>What is Parkinson's. (2016). Parkinsons.org.au. http://www.parkinsons.org.au/what-is-parkinsons</ref> There is little understanding as to how PD develops but it is thought that multiple factors such as pesticides and toxins or genetics are major contributors.<ref name="Vic" /> PD is currently incurable however there are a range of strategies used to manage the disease and delay its effects. Since PD results from a deficiency in dopamine, the most common way to manage the disease is through dopamine replacement or mimicking medication.<ref name="Vic" /> There is no 'best' medication for the disease as each person exhibits different symptoms and responds individually to different medicines. PD is highly associated with anxiety and depression.<ref>Martínez-Martín, P. & Damián, J. (2010). Parkinson disease: Depression and anxiety in Parkinson disease. Nature Reviews Neurology, 6(5), 243-245.</ref> However, exercise can be a fundamental tool in reducing these symptoms.<ref>Martinsen, E. (1990). Benefits of Exercise for the Treatment of Depression.
